# Design-and-Analysis-of-Algorithms-Project

This project consists of two exercises about algorithms and data structures.
The assignment outline is contained in the recovery_project.pdf file.
The first exercise is about dynamic programming and heap priority queues.
The second exercise is a max-flow/min-cut problem (solved using the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm).
